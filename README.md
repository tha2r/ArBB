PHP and MYSQL forum software.

Arabian Bulletin Board , An old Project i started back when i was learning php in 2005 to 2007.

this php forum software i started back when i was like 15 years old so it must be full of bugs and some copied codes, 
it's good as a study case as it's not a complete project and i am not thinking of reviving it soon.

so it is a deprecated project

feel free to use the code, use the script, produce reproduce, as you like ;)

this was an educational experiance that i learned alot from and one day i might actiually rebuild the whole project from the scratch.
